# analysis_oriented_metadata_for_data_lakes

Data lakes are supposed to let analysts reach a better experience by crossing several sources of data. Nonetheless, this is not possible without a metadata governance system capitalizing incrementally all analysis experiences performed on datasets. The aim of this paper is to have a data lake easily accessible, reusable and that capitalizes on all user experiences. To meet this need, we propose a model that summarizes more than 70 analysis-oriented metadata attributes. Our model includes the description of the datasets and their attributes, as well as all metadata related to the Machine Learning analyses performed on these datasets. Our model is implemented in a Nosql data store within the data lake. We present three use cases, with real data, including dataset similarity detection or machine learning guidance. We show how to easily access these metadata through NoSQL queries.
